Python Version 
==============

The initial release of MysteryMachine is intended to run with the python2.6
interpreter however it is required that any code run under both python2.5
and the '-3' switch in python 2.6 to ensure support for python 3 when pour
libraries support it.

The unit testing framework will do these tests for you if you write useful unit
tests for your code.

Rationale
---------
Sooner or later we are going to have to support python 3.0 as the libraries
we use move over to python3.0. Critically however most linux distributions
seem to have onl got python2.5 in them at this stage. So we are
stuck with enusre we support at least 2.5, and 2.6 . But we need to look forward
to ensure that the code we write isn't going to cause a massive maintenance
burden in the future. Hence we must test with python2.6 -3.
