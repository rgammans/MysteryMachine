Templates
---------

Templates category name which by convention stores object which are
only used parent objects.

In some previous versions of the documentation Templates also referred to
saved `Systems <System>`_ containing only Empty categories and a Templates
category with appropriate parents. The aim here is to provide starting
documents for new users so they are not left with too much of a blank screen.
