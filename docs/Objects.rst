Objects
=======

Objects form the core of the MysteryMachine architecture. 

Every document which MysteryMachine generates has a 'home object' it refers to, for a example the home object for a character sheet, is the object which represent the character whose character sheet it is.

However the main aim of object is as a container for `<Attributes>`_ , these where the actual information and text that MysteryMachine handles is stored.


Objects can have a parent from which they inherit default attributes. (see `<ObjectModel>`_ )
