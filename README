Installation
============

If you are installing from a built source distribution then the command:-

     python setup.py install -d <DirectoryToInstallInto>

should work, if you have python virtualenv and setuptools already installed, and
windows users should see the note under pyparsing below. 

This will create a python virtualenv in the specified installation directory and
install MysteryMachine, a customised yapsy plus all of the dependencies into to
it.

You can still install MysteryMachine into you global environment if you don't have
or want to install virtualenv by running

     python setup.py install_here

instead.

If you are installing from the mercurial repo you need the following libraries
on your PYTHONPATH. Once the libraries below and MysteryMachine itself are on your
python path the scripts in the 'scripts' directory should work. Or you can install
a patched version of yapsy (patch is in the patches directory) and paver then use:- 

    paver sdist

to build you own source distribution and install from that.

Windows Install Quick Reference
-------------------------------

To install on windows I suggest the following commands, if you use python for
other applications want more control I suggest you read all of this README before
doing this

    1. Download a recent Python (2.6.x is recommended) from www.python.org and install it.
    2. Download mercurial from  http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg-winbuild/downloads/ and install it. 
    3. From the MysteryMachine zip file run 
            python install -d c:\mysterymachine

    4. Find where your TCL scripts are stored , this will normally by c:\pythonXX\tcl\tclY.Y
       then edit c:\mysterymachine\scripts\activate to add this following line at
       the beginning:-
            set TCL_LIBRARY=c:\pythonXX\tcl\tclY,Z
        
        where X,Y are version numbers in the file names, eg if you have a folder of yout
        computer called c:\python26\tcl\tcl8.5 you woud add this line:=
            set TCL_LIBRARY=c:\python26\tcl\tcl8.5

    5. Run c:\mysterymachine\scripts\activate
    6. You ready to go - make sure you  


Libraries Required
------------------

You will need to install the following Python packages to use the 
MysteryMachine .

Yapsy > 1.7 : A Patch for versions lower than this can be found patches
pyparsing > 1.5.0

Yapsy 
'''''
Yapsy does not currently meet our python3 requirements, and in fact the use of 
exec, rather than execfile creates a small security race hazard. Wether
our application's useis sensitive enough to worry about this is a moot point
though. 

Having said that since for python3 we need to fix yapsy - changing it to be
secure as well strikes me as a good idea.

Additionall MysteryMachine ships with a patched ersion of Yapsy which should
be backwardly compatible with 1.7 - but add a filter mechanism which is currently
used so we ignore UnTrusted plugins.

Pyparsing
'''''''''

Actually you may be able to make MysteryMachine work with Pyparsing 1.4, and the
parser was orginally written for it.
However the whitespace handling code is different between the two releases and 1.4
may damage rst documents when used with the settings required for 1.5.

Also Pyparsing 1.4 did not throw and exception if it couldn't parse the whole string
it would just silently discard the remaining output. SO don't blame me if you
attempt to use it with and early version and find your mssing half your character sheet.

The automatic setup will try to copy install the current version of pyparsing
from my development environment into MysteryMachine's library if you haven't
already got a global copy.

Mercurial
'''''''''
MysteryMachine needs to be able to use Mercurial as a library , on a POSIX
OS (Linux & MacOs) just installing mercurial asa  system applciation should be 
enough , but on windows you will need to ensure it is install as a python library,
if this  doesn't work, `easy_install mercurial` will download it for you but
it require python2.X-dev and working C toolchain installed . But that is quite
common on Unix machines.

I haven't yet worked out the best to get Mercurial installed appropriately on windows,
due to the common lack of Visual Studio , which is required to build the C extension
parts. However a binary version which can be used a a library can be downloaded from
http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg-winbuild/downloads/


Bpython
'''''''
This package os no longer considerer required as it doesn't work on windows, 
however it is recommended on those platforms where it does work.

Use easy_install or your OS package manager
to install it. If it ia not already installed the installer will try to fetch and 
install it automatically.

Docutils
''''''''
MysteryMachine was first developed with docutils 0.4 but I'm currently using 0.6 myself
as it generates less noise of on the python comaptiblity tests. I suspect 0.5 and 0.6 should
work equally. 0.4 will probably work too but I haven't tested it in a while.

Docutils can either be installed wiht easy_install or the installer will pull in the
latest version for you.

PyYaml
''''''
Yaml is the current prefered format for the MysteryMachine config file , and if you
intend to start MysteryMachine with it default settings it will need PyYaml.
PyYaml can be install easily using easy_install. Like so:
    easy_install pyyaml

But it should pulled in with the installer.


Tkinter & Tcl/Tk
''''''''''''''''
These are only require for the Idle based Ui, but currently the installer doesn't
setup the tcl/tk environment correctly (see https://bitbucket.org/ianb/virtualenv/issue/40/tkinter-fails-in-a-virtual-env )
to fix this you need ensure the TCL_LIBARRY environmenr variable point to the TCL script
and srtart up files. The easiest way to do this is to add a line to your
activate.bat which set this varaibell to pint to the tcl directories tghat ship with
python.

Running MysteryMachine
======================

Mystery machine has a two Cli ui's at the moment which dumps you at the
python shell with the global 'ctx' bound to MysteryMachine Library.

The are basically identical, the primary one is base on bpython and can
be started like this:

    python mysterymachine --ui=Ui.cli.BPython

Bpython support auto completion and help pop-up documentation. The
down side of Bpython is that it requires a Unix (or unix-like) terminal
to run in, so is not compatible with windows.

For windows , althought it shoulkd work anywhere that has python there is
an alternative Ui based on the Idle development environment, this
Ui can be started like this:-

    python mysterymachine --ui=Ui.cli.Idle

Similiarily this supports auto-completion and pop-up documentation but
where as Bpython will show the complete docstring, Idle tries to 
shorten it.
