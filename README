Installation
============

None, currently not enough the project is complete to make the 
concept of installatio useful.

You can however run the system tests.


Libraries Required
------------------

You will need to install the following Python packages to use the 
MysteryMachine .

Yapsy > 1.x : A Patch for versions lower than this can be found patches

Yapsy 
'''''
Yapsy does not currently meet our python3 requirements, and tin fact the use of 
exec, rather than execfile creates a small security race hazard. Wether
our application's useis sensitive enough to worry about this is a moot point
though. 

Having said that since for python3 we need to fix yapsy - changing it to be
secure as well strikes me as a good idea.
