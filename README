Installation
============

None, currently not enough the project is complete to make the 
concept of installatio useful.

You can however run the system tests.


Libraries Required
------------------

You will need to install the following Python packages to use the 
MysteryMachine .

Yapsy > 1.x : A Patch for versions lower than this can be found patches
pyparsing > 1.5.0

Yapsy 
'''''
Yapsy does not currently meet our python3 requirements, and tin fact the use of 
exec, rather than execfile creates a small security race hazard. Wether
our application's useis sensitive enough to worry about this is a moot point
though. 

Having said that since for python3 we need to fix yapsy - changing it to be
secure as well strikes me as a good idea.

Pyparsing
'''''''''

Actually you may be able to make MysteryMachine work with Pyparsing 1.4, and the
parser was orginally written for it.
However the whitespace handling code is different between the two releases and 1.4
may damage rst documents when used with the settings required for 1.5.

Also Pyparsing 1.4 did not throw and exception if it couldn't parse the whole string
it would just silently discard the remaining output. SO don't blame me if you
attempt to use it with and early version and find your mssing half your character sheet.
